It was inspired from [BackStack](https://github.com/pwalczyszyn/backstack) which was inspired from [ViewNavigator API](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/spark/components/ViewNavigator.html) from the mobile SDK of the [Apache Flex framework](http://incubator.apache.org/flex/).
